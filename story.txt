John landed at Berlinâ€™s airport, excited to eat bratwurst.
He had a delicious Bratwurst at the Berlin airport.
But, when John arrived at the baeckerei he was greeted by a hund at the door.
He couldn't help but notice the hund's resemblence to the bratwurst.
John then went to the biergarten to have several beers.
John didn't expect to pass the Eltz with guards wearing lederhose!
John considered stealing a BMW to escape the guards, before deciding he wanted to steal a porsche instead. 
He hopped into the Porsche and hot-wired it as fast as he could so that he could escape.
As soon as he got the car running, the stereo started blasting Rammstein on full volume.
He headed to the castle at 90kph to see a party of women wearing dirndls.
The women were wettbewerbsfaehig and challenged John do a battle of baking gebaeck.
He grabbed all the Gebaeck and took off with one of the women's BMW.
John tried turning on the car's klimaanlage but it wasn't working.
John quickly made his way to Raesfeld, eager to share his loot with his 200 children.
Upon arriving at Raesfeld, John found the Schloss jammed with Doener and apfelkuchen.
All the children wanted a gebaeck and he realized he wouldn't have enough to share.
After sharing his loot, John shuttled his 200 children to the Flughafen in Berlin.
About halfway through his journey home, John ran into a pack of wild vicious hunds!
